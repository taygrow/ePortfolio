                <center><p><font size = "4">For this project, I chose to utilize the program Canva for Educators to execute the creation of my animation video. I decided to use the
theme The Four Elements for my video. I began by adding in a blue background as a blank slate for my animation. I then chose to go with the them of the essence
of four elements. I chose to start with grass, trees, and flowers for the element of "earth". I brought them in with a "rise" animation, and slowed down the 
speed at which they came in. Then, I added in an animation of a kite for the "wind" element. I also chose to add in windmills and have them animated in a rotating
position. I copied those two times so that I could keep with the theme. For water, I chose to bring in a rain animation. Finally, I chose to use two pieces of wood
and an animated fire. I applied a "rise" animation to each vector, and switched up the directions in which element came in. Then, I applied a typewriter-esque
animation to the text boxes for my intro and the element names. Then, I exported the file to iMovie and added in my narration. I chose to bring up the volume of my
voice and "reduce background noise" to help promote high sound quality. Finally, I uploaded my video to YouTube and set the thumbnail.
