                <center><p><font size = "4">I created a tutorial on the service Quizlet Learn. I have loved utilizing this tool as I have worked through undergrad, and it is a great tool for personalized learning within the field of educational technology. I began by introducing myself and then taking the viewer through the process of creating their own study set. Once I had created a study set, I showed the viewer how to navigate into the "Learn" function. Once we were in Learn, I showed the viewer how to access the menu to work through and personalize the experience for their liking. I then walked them through the process until mastery of the subject, and took the viewer through a mock Exam in Quizlet Learn as well. Once I had completed my recording, I saved it and exported it into iMovies, where I was able to trim the video and address the sound quality. Finally, I uploaded my tutorial to YouTube.</font><br> </p>
