                <center><p><font size = "4">For the book cover, I decided to go with one of my favorite books, to kill a mockingbird. Knowing that the most pivotal points in the book takes place inside a courtroom, I decided to go with the courtroom scene as the base of my work. I chose all of my free images from the site Pixabay. I then used GIMP to bring it all together. I started off with a vertical base and added in my courtroom image. Then I layered on the vector images of a gavel and a mockingbird, both from Pixabay as well. I then added the final layer, the title. I had started with white text, but felt that black fit the theme of the book a little better. The text was difficult to read against the colorful courtroom background, and the viewer lost site of the gavel and mockingbird as well, so I chose to bring down the opacity of the courtroom image and add in a filled white background. The white from the lights in the courtroom image were distracting from the vector images, so I used the erase and auto-select tools to select some of the white from the lights and take the focus off of the ceiling of the image. I was then left with my final cover image.</font> </p></center> <br><br><br>

            <center><p><font size = "4">For my logo, I was picking my brain as to what I should include and finally decided to incorporate the University of Florida's college of education into my design. I had never used the program Inkscape that I could recall, so it was a bit of a learning curve to remember how to work through it. I started off by incorporating a circle for the "apple" of the design. I then went in and added a leaf using a semicircle. I switched over to the rectangle feature and added the stem and three books. I chose orange and blue, naturally, to fit with the UF theme. I then used the text tool to add in the COE as well as the UF text. I chose to duplicate the COE text and add offset the text in order to make the main portion of the logo stand out. I offset the text with a darker red to stand out from the bright red of the apple.</p></center>
